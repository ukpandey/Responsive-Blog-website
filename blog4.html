        10. Chopper Vs. Kumadori: Chopper Unleashed The Monster Point For The
        First Time In This Fight
      </h1>

      <p class="font1">
        Chopper's fight against Kumadori is quite easily his best fight to date
        and also among the greatest that any Straw Hat has fought so far. Taking
        place in Enies Lobby, the fight saw Chopper get beaten by the powers of
        Kumadori, forcing him to resort to using Monster Point. This held great
        importance for Chopper's character to grow as he was hated for being
        like a monster, yet to protect his friend, Chopper didn't mind turning
        into an actual monster.

        9. Usopp & Chopper Vs. Mr. 4 & Miss Merry Christmas: This Fight Showed
        Everyone Usopp's Brave Face
      </h1>
      <p class="font1">
        In the Alabasta arc, Usopp and Chopper teamed up to fight against Mr. 4
        and Miss Merry Christmas of the Baroque Works. Although the two were
        clearly out of their depth in terms of strength, they managed to pull
        through and win by using clever strategies. The fight also saw Usopp
        take a stand against turning his back on his opponent because his
        captain was being insulted. Using that as his fuel, Usopp managed to
        overcome Miss Merry Christmas.

        8. Nami Vs. Kalifa: This Fight Showed Nami's Superior Intellect In
        Fights
      </h1>
      <p class="font1">
        Nami has always been considered to be one of the weakest members of the
        crew when it comes to physical strength, however, she is blessed with
        abilities that no other Straw Hat possesses. Nami's understanding of the
        science of weather is way beyond an average human's level and this was
        displayed in her fight against Kalifa. For Robin's sake, Nami stepped up
        and defeated a CP-9 agent with superhuman strength within a matter of
        minutes.

        7. Franky Vs. Senõr Pink: This Fight Displayed A Clash Of Two Mighty Men
        With An Emotional Twist
      </h1>
      <p class="font1">
        Franky's fight against Senõr Pink is easily one of the best that the
        cyborg has engaged in since joining the Straw Hats. Although Franky had
        stronger weapons up his sleeve that would've helped him defeat Senõr
        easily, such as the Franky Shogun, he relied on his own strength to
        prove that he was a manly figure indeed.The fight covers everything from
        high-octane action to tear-jerking moments as Russian's backstory kicks
        in. Without a doubt, this fight is up there with the best in the story
        so far.

        6. Roronoa Zoro Vs. Ryuma: This Fight Saw Zoro Test His Limits To Obtain
        A Black Blade
      </h1>
      <p class="front">
        Zoro has always received some of the best fights in One Piece and
        rightly so, as much of his character revolves around the theme of
        growing strong. At Thriller Bark, Zoro fought against the zombie of
        Ryuma, a legendary Samurai from Wano Country. Ryuma might've been quite
        weak in this fight, however, that didn't take away from the fact that he
        was a legendary figure. By using his full power, Zoro set the zombie
        ablaze and obtained the Kokuto: Shusui.

        5.Sanji Vs. Jabra: This Fight Saw Sanji Save Usopp & Unleash The Diable
        Jambe
      </h1>
      <p class="front">
        Sanji initially clashed against Kalifa of CP-9 and lost to her terribly.
        Later, however, he managed to save the day by protecting Usopp from
        imminent death against Jabra. Taking on Jabra in his place, Sanji pushed
        himself beyond all his limits and managed to awaken the power of the
        Devil's Leg: Diable Jambe. With this technique, Sanji could generate
        flames from his legs which were deadly enough to defeat Jabra in just
        two kicks.

        4. Zoro Vs. Daz Bones: This Fight Forced Zoro To Evolve In The Midst Of
        Combat
      </h1>
      <p class="front">
        Zoro took on Mr. 1 of the Baroque Works organization, named Daz Bones,
        in the Alabasta arc of One Piece. Although strong, Zoro was hardly a
        match for Daz since he couldn't cut steel at the time.On the brink of
        death, he managed to hear the breath of all things and possibly
        channeled into a rudimentary form of Ryou, allowing him to cut steel and
        defeat Mr. 1.

        3. Luffy Vs. Rob Lucci: This Fight Showed Luffy's Undying Determinations
        In The Best Of Ways
      </h1>
      <p class="front">
        Monkey D. Luffy is known to be a tenacious fighter, and every opponent
        that he's fought so far acknowledges that fact. Against Rob Lucci, Luffy
        displayed this ability in the most incredible manner by refusing to fall
        until Lucci was beaten. Luffy was carrying the burden of his friend,
        Nico Robin, who he planned on rescuing from the depths of hell and for
        that reason, his back refused to touch the ground until Lucci was taken
        down.

        2. Luffy Vs. Katakuri: This Fight Gave Forced Luffy To Evolve & Gave Him
        A Worthy Rival
      </h1>
      <p class="front">
        Luffy Vs. Katakuri remains to be one of the best fights in One Piece for
        countless reasons, the most important of which revolves around the fight
        forcing Luffy on his last legs. Although strong, Luffy was nowhere near
        Katakuri's level and the fight itself was like training for him.
        Managing to learn Future Sight Observation Haki in this battle, Luffy
        unleashed Snakeman to defeat Katakuri, but not before he earned his
        respect as a worthy rival
      </p>

      <h1>
        1. Luffy Vs. Usopp: This Fight Tested The Integrity Of The Straw Hat
        Pirates Like None Other
      </h1>
      <p class="front">
        Luffy's fight against Usopp is quite different from all the others
        mentioned on the list as it is a fight between two crewmates, yet that
        is what makes it incredible. Undoubtedly, it is painful to watch, but at
        the same time, it is written masterfully and builds up the unraveling
        conflict at Water 7. The fight gives the impression that the crew has
        started to fall apart, evoking a feeling of despair in fans' hearts, but
        also makes the victory in Enies Lobby all the more beautiful.
