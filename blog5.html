      <h1>
        10. Jinbe (3,000+ Users)
      </h1>

      <p class="font1">
        Knight of the Sea Jinbe is the helmsman for the Straw Hats, and the
        tenth member of the crew. Jinbe is a whale shark fish-man, and his
        specialty (not surprisingly) is Fish-Man Karate. He was once one of the
        Sun Pirates, and he shares his former captain's dream of equality
        between humans and fish-men. As a fish-man, he's the tallest member of
        the Straw Hats, and while he's got the rounded body of a whale, he has
        the face of a Japanese demon.
      </p>

      </div>
      <h1>9.Franky (4800+ Users)</h1>
      <p class="font1">
        It's no surprise that bulked up Franky is also known as Iron Man. He's
        the shipwright for the Straw Hats, and the eighth member of the crew.
        Franky is the name he chose to hide his real identity as Cutty Flam from
        South Blue. A former member of Tom's Workers, his body was so damaged he
        became a cyborg. Originally an enemy of the Straw Hats with his Franky
        Family crew, they became allies, and he joined Luffy's crew to fulfill
        his dream of creating a dream ship to travel the world.

      </div>
      <h1>8. Brook (8,100+ Users)</h1>
      <p class="font1">
        Also called Soul King, Brook is the musician of the Straw Hats, and a
        swordsman too. The ninth member of the crew, Brook was once one of the
        Rumbar Pirates. He died, and came back to life by eating the Yomi Yomi
        no Mi, a type of Devil Fruit. The only catch is, his soul comes back to
        his body no matter what condition it's in, and how much decay has
        already occurred. Along with resurrecting him, it also gives him the
        ability to move his soul around and leave his skeleton, similar to
        astral projection.

      </div>
      <h1>7. Nami (11,700+ Users)</h1>
      <p class="font1">
        "Cat Burglar" Nami is the navigator of the Straw Hats, and one of the
        core members. She is, in many ways, the brains of the crew. If Usopp's
        role was to humor along Luffy's goofy side, Nami's role is to keep
        Luffy's goofy side in check. Now more than ever, Nami's role in the crew
        is one of the most vital. If anyone of the Straw Hats is responsible for
        getting the crew to Laugh Tale, then it's definitely Nami
      </p>
      <div class="post-img">
        <img src="img/fifth5.jpeg" alt="" />
      </div>
      <h1>6. Usopp (11,800+ Users)</h1>
      <p class="front">
        "God" Usopp is a brave warrior of the sea— or so he likes to introduce
        himself. What we do know is that he is indeed a 'warrior' of the sea; as
        for the brave part, that's questionable. Usopp was one of the first to
        join Luffy in his journey. Of all the Straw Hats, he is the closest to
        Luffy age-wise and is always seen clowning together with him. It's
        frankly arguable whether Usopp's main duty is to be the marksman of the
        crew or their comic relief.
      </p>
      <div class="post-img">
        <img src="img/fifht6.jpeg" alt="" />
      </div>
      <h1>5.Tony Tony Chopper (11,800+ Users)</h1>
      <p class="front">
        Tony Tony Chopper is -depending on the narrative— either the genius
        doctor of the Straw Hats or their mascot. As all the loyal fans already
        know, Chopper was originally an unassuming reindeer— that is, until he
        ate the Human Human fruit. Eating the Human Human fruit not only granted
        Chopper human-level sentience, but it also somehow awakened a supreme
        talent in medicine lying dormant within him. It's his dream to be able
        to cure any disease, and he's determined to travel the world to learn
        how.
      </p>
      <div class="post-img">
        <img src="img/fifth7.jpeg" alt="" />
      </div>
      <h1>4. Robin (14,000+ Users)</h1>
      <p class="front">
        Robin is the only Straw Hat who asked to join the crew rather than be
        invited by Luffy. Nico Robin is also called Devil Child and Light of the
        Revolution. She's the only survivor of the destruction of the West Blue
        island Ohara.Robin is the archaeologist of the Strawhats; she is
        fascinated with all things history. Her role in the grand scheme of
        things is just as important as the navigator. Without her deciphering
        the Poneglyphs, (a skill she alone possesses), finding One Piece would
        be much harder, to say the least.
      </p>
      <div class="post-img">
        <img src="img/fifth8.jpeg" alt="" />
      </div>
      <h1>3. Sanji (22,700+ Users)</h1>
      <p class="front">
        The Fallen prince Sanji is yet another core member of the Strawhats.
        Some would argue that his role as the cook is less important than the
        navigator or archaeologist, but Luffy would definitely argue
        otherwise—but that's to be expected from a guy who thinks with his
        belly. Sanji's strength ranking is in the top 3 among the crew; he is an
        all-rounder with both power and intellect.
      </p>
      <div class="post-img">
        <img src="img/fifth9.jpeg" alt="" />
      </div>
      <h1>2. Zoro ( 82,000+ Users)</h1>
      <p class="front">
        Roronoa "Pirate Hunter" Zoro is the second in command and Luffy's
        right-hand man. He's a master of Santoryu, his very own style of
        swordsmanship, and one of the four most powerful Straw Hats. The former
        bounty hunter is also one of the twelve pirates who are called the
        "Worst Generation", known for their daring acts against the World
        Government, and the large bounties on their heads.
      </p>
      <div class="post-img">
        <img src="img/fifth10.jpeg" alt="" />
      </div>
      <h1>1. Luffy (101,000+ Users)</h1>
      <p class="front">
        And last, but definitely not least, is Monkey D. Luffy. The man who
        aspires to be the Pirate King and the goofy main protagonist of this
        series. It's only natural for Luffy to be the most fan-favorite
        character of the series. Because not only is he the face representing
        One Piece, he is the face representing anime as a whole media.
