      <h1>10. Kuja Pirates, Perfume Yuda</h1>

      <p class="font1">
        Starting off this list is a ship that immediately communicates the
        culture and aesthetic personality of its crew. The Kuja are a race of
        Amazonian women residing on a tropical island whose architecture
        resembles that of ancient China. A predominant technology on the island
        is the use of snakes as weapons and tools, such as bows for the Kuja
        artillery. It's a deep and realized culture within the One Piece world
        and somehow all of that information can be addressed on the Perfume
        Yuda, as its red, traditional wooden paneling and two giant snakes
        guiding it at the helm are more than just visual texture.
      </p>
      <div class="post-img">

      </div>
      <h1>9. Saruyama Alliance, Victory Hunter</h1>
      <p class="font1">
        A less talked about gem within the One Piece mythos, the Saruyama
        Alliance was an incredibly intriguing thread that went by quickly within
        the story. While the crew dedicated to finding the lost city of gold is
        home to a couple of ships, what wins it out on this list is "Salvage
        King" Masira's Victory Hunter. It's sad that the story never goes into
        more depth about the alliance, because the Victory Hunter is an
        incredible looking ship that just peaks with curiosity. Its figurehead
        is a giant monkey that plays deafening cymbals, the sides are giant
        bananas, and the interior seems to be filled with tropical trees if not
        an entire jungle. It's definitely a ship worth its own collector's set.
      </p>

      </div>
      <h1>8. Barto Club, Going Luffy Senpai</h1>
      <p class="font1">
        Moving onto visual eccentricity of a different breed, the Bartolomeo's
        Going Luffy Senpai is a visual delight on so many levels. At one end, it
        showcases a silly and hilarious obsession of One Piece's in-world
        fanboy. At another, it's a touching homage to the Straw Hat's history
        and their long lost home, the Going Merry. Besides the housing in the
        middle resembling the Going Merry's figurehead, the frame of the ship
        itself closely matches the architecture of the original ship. One can
        also spot tangerine trees planted in the back and Chopper's antlers
        decorating the sides. It's a sight that sparks enjoyment on so many
        levels, getting any fan to love One Piece a little more like the Barto
        Club.

      </div>
      <h1>7. The Baratie</h1>
      <p class="font1">
        While the Going Luffy Senpai is just an homage, the Baratie is an entire
        story. It's a sea traveling restaurant that acts as home and employment
        for ex-pirate "Red Foot" Zeff and his band of criminal chefs. Just
        seeing a floating building is enough to catch any seafarer's eye, but
        the Baratie is more than just visual flavor. Its functionality for
        escapes as well as transformations into decks and other ships shows
        enough fantastical flexibility to give Transformers a run for their
        money.

      <h1>6. Whitebeard Pirates, Moby Dick</h1>
      <p class="front">
        To house the overwhelming force of the Whitebeard Pirates, the
        Whitebeard Pirates would also need an incredible ship to communicate
        their size and intensity, and the Moby Dick does just that. Named after
        the destructive and illustrious namesake for one of Herman Melville's
        best novels, the Moby Dick itself resembles a giant blue whale,
        immediately intimidating its foes with its size and challenging anyone
        to try and capture its residents.Like a lot of things during the
        Paramount War arc, the Moby Dick had to bid a sad farewell, as its crew
        stared in regret and melancholy at its final moments, showing a deep
        history to go with its design.
      </p>

      </div>
      <h1>5.Heart Pirates, Polar Tang</h1>
      <p class="front">
        Barely making it on the list as just a ship, the Heart Pirates' Polar
        Tang gets major points for its visual opposition to the status quo,
        being literally a yellow submarine (good to know your taste in music,
        Oda). However, to its credit, there are some nods to a traditional ship,
        as a wooden deck decorates the top and the jolly roger of the crew is
        sported on the side. However, beyond just its immediate difference to
        any other ship, the Polar Tang does offer certain advantages that
        regular pirate ships can't, such as evasion via diving into deep waters,
        something that comes in handy quite a few times, as well as a functional
        operating room to facilitate its surgeon captain.
      </p>

      </div>
      <h1>4. Firetank Pirates, Nostra Castello</h1>
      <p class="front">
        The Nostra Castello is, at one level, a ship with an interesting design,
        showcasing a few of the aesthetic traits of the Firetank Pirates, such
        as its figurehead alluding to its captain's Capone "Gang" Bege's Devil
        Fruit power and status as a rook in the Big Mom ranks. However, it is
        its functionality that really showcases the power and intimidation of
        Bege and his crew, and the Nostra Castello is an amphibious ship that
        drives on land with treads that really compliment the two cannons on the
        figurehead, making the vessel both a pirate ship and a pirate tank.
      </p>
      <div class="post-img">
        <img src="img/six8.jpeg" alt="" />
      </div>
      <h1>3. Big Mom Pirates, Queen Mama Chanter</h1>
      <p class="front">
        It's no wonder that the flagship for all the insanity of the Whole Cake
        Island Arc showcases that same kind of oversaturated flavor as
        everything about the ship's designs speaks excess and... well, just
        speaks. The Queen Mama Chanter is a large ship whose size absolutely
        dwarfs the Straw Hats' own ship and is decorated (and probably made of)
        various sweets, such as ice cream, waffle cones, chocolate, and even
        Pocky.There are also splashes of a lot of bright colors along the frame
        and its flags. However, best of all, the Queen Mama Chanter is a
        singing, talking ship that alludes its presence to its foes with a song.
        While this might be silly in some cases, it is a death cry within the
        One Piece world, signaling that Big Mom is coming.
      </p>

      </div>
      <h1>2. Straw Hat Pirates, Thousand Sunny</h1>
      <p class="front">
        There's a lot of love in the One Piece world for the Straw Hats'
        original ship, the Going Merry. Its history and callback to a simpler
        time for the crew are enough to bring a tear to any fan's eye. And while
        its design wasn't all that flashy to make it on this list, its successor
        more than makes up for it, as it acts as host to the Straw Hats' new
        adventures as well as a litany of interesting design choices. Its
        exterior bears an adorable lion figurehead, a grassy lawn, and even a
        garden. The interior has rooms for the boys and girls, a fully furnished
        kitchen and an aquarium that shows and catches fish, and special work
        rooms for Nami, Zoro, and Chopper. Beyond design, like any good ship, is
        functionality, as the Thousand Sunny also sports laser cannons, rocket
        and propeller power methods of escape, various ships housed inside, and
        a pool setting.
      </p>
      <div class="post-img">
        <img src="img/six10.jpeg" alt="" />
      </div>
      <h1>1. Thriller Bark Pirates, Thriller Bark</h1>
      <p class="front">
        Topping this list is a ship that literally eats other ships. Acting as a
        refuge for Gecko Moriah and his Thriller Bark Pirates, Thriller Bark
        gets every point on this list's criteria for just being a moving island,
        home to a castle, graveyard, and a monstrous exterior frame to capture
        other ships. It's the only ship that the Straw Hats' have ever gotten
        lost in, as there are various levels within the castle alone that house
        evil experiments, Victorian garishness, and the histories of its zombie
        warriors. It immediately communicates the gothic styles of its crew and
        has an air of intrigue and intimidation to really sell it as a landmark
        in the world's mysterious Florian Triangle. In other words, Thriller
        Bark thrills on so many levels.
