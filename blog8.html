      <h1>10. Brook's Infectious Laugh</h1>

      <p class="font1">
        As a talking skeleton with an afro that can play almost any instrument,
        Brook is already a unique character within the world of One Piece.
        However, it's his laugh that truly sets him apart. Brook's laugh appears
        to come from the famous sea diddy "Bink's Brew," a song that holds
        immense sentimentality because he used to sing it for Laboon when he was
        still alive. Not only does Brook's laugh pull on fans' heartstrings but
        the tone and pitch of his "yo-ho-ho" laugh are truly infectious.
      </p>

      <h1>9. Dorry & Broggy's Boisterous Chuckle</h1>
      <p class="font1">
        These giants are two peas in a pod, despite dueling with one another for
        approximately 100 years. It only makes sense that these two pirates'
        laughs are just as big and boisterous as they are.Dorry's
        "gegyagyagyagya" and Broggy's "gabababababa" have as much gusto to them
        as the men have fighting spirit. But what's also unique about these
        laughs is how well they match with one another, alluding that despite
        their ongoing conflict, these two pirates might get along better than
        fans initially think.

      <h1>8. Hogback's Arrogant Snicker</h1>
      <p class="font1">
        Thriller Bark's Hogback is already an enigmatic character with an almost
        vampiric character design and Frankenstein-like personality. He's
        definitely one creepy foe. However, his laugh only adds to this
        character's unnerving persona. Hogback's laugh, like many other One
        Piece characters, is a departure from the usual. It's a higher-pitched,
        "fosfosfosfosfos" and his laughter usually follows an arrogant comment
        on his part. Hogback's laugh may not be as creepy as his character
        design, but it does add to his overall arrogant persona and character as
        a "genius doctor."

      <h1>7. Kaido's Intimidating Chortle</h1>
      <p class="font1">
        Renowned as the world's "Strongest Creature," Kaido has an impressive
        character design. With a towering height, impressive build, scars,
        piercing eyes, and horns growing out of the top of his head, fans can
        see how he earned the title of Strongest Creature. His appearance paired
        with his warrior spirit cements his status as one of the Four Emperors
        and Kaido's laugh only functions to aid his overall intimidating aura.
        His "worororo" laugh sounds guttural and almost like a war cry. It's
        truly an unnerving sound for his enemies.

      <h1>6. Foxy's Mischievous Laugh</h1>
      <p class="front">
        Foxy, just as his name may suggest, is a sneaky and conniving pirate.
        His personality combined with his hair resembling pointed ears and
        wearing a large grin on his face, he does look very foxlike. The
        similarities don't stop there, as he isn't above using dirty tricks to
        get what he wants.Thankfully, his silly and underhanded schemes never
        seem to work out in his favor. With Luffy as his proclaimed
        arch-nemesis, Foxy has repeatedly caused mischief for the Straw Hat
        Crew. Fortunately, his laugh is a distinct "fehfehfehfeh" and can always
        alert the Straw Hats when this particular pirate is trying to stir up
        some trouble.

      <h1>5.Jaguar D. Saul's Endearing & Awkward Laugh</h1>
      <p class="front">
        A kind-hearted giant, Jaguar D. Saul's laugh may just be a fan favorite.
        As the giant was shipwrecked on Ohara, he befriended a young Robin and
        taught her how to laugh. His iconic "dereshishishishi" would bring a
        smile to Robin's face. However, his laugh was more than just endearing:
        Jaguar D. Saul taught Robin to laugh even if she was sad or in pain. His
        "dereshishishishi" would become a source of comfort for her until she
        would inevitably meet the Straw Hats and laugh on her own.

      </div>
      <h1>4. Perona's Haughty Giggle</h1>
      <p class="front">
        The "Ghost Princess" Perona has her own unique look and laugh just like
        every other One Piece character. The young girl dressed in an almost
        lolita fashion with a crown and parasol, which only adds to her title
        and compliments her Devil Fruit power. Perona's ability to create and
        control ghosts comes from the Horo Horo no Mi. Her laugh is a variation
        of the name of the Devil Fruit she ate, "horohorohoro". It's higher
        pitched and seems to also reflect her "Princess" image due to how it
        compliments her haughty attitude.

      </div>
      <h1>3. Brulee's Wicked Cackle</h1>
      <p class="front">
        An officer of the Big Mom Pirates and a Mirror Human, Brulee is an
        intimidating character. Her appearance and power seem to draw on the
        characterization of wicked witches within fairy tales. With her long
        purple hair, grayish skin, dark lips, and long pointed nose, Brulee has
        the appearance of a stereotypical witch.Her laugh also aids her wicked
        appearance. Brulee's signature "wiwwiwwiwwi" sounds very reminiscent of
        a witch's cackle. Her appearance, ability to manipulate others with her
        mirrors, and laugh make Brulee stand out as a truly unique character.
      </p>
      <div class="post-img">
        <img src="img/89.jpeg" alt="" />
      </div>
      <h1>2. Pica's Unexpected Giggle</h1>
      <p class="front">
        Pica, one of the top three officers of the Donquixote Pirates, has a
        very intimidating appearance. Large in stature with bulging muscles and
        dressed in gold gladiator armor, Pica is a terrifying foe. However,
        Pica's laugh is the exact opposite. This pirate has an extremely
        high-pitched voice, so his laugh is detrimental to his overall image.
        Pica will go as far as brutally murdering someone if they tease him
        about his voice. Pica laughs with a very distinct
        "pikkya-pikkya-pikkyarara," which is a cute characteristic for this
        overall aggressive and intimidating Donquixote Pirate.
      </p>
      <div class="post-img">
        <img src="img/810.jpeg" alt="" />
      </div>
      <h1>1. Nekomamushi's Cat-like Chortle</h1>
      <p class="front">
        As Guardian of the Whale Forest on the Island of Zou, the "Ruler of
        Night" Nekomamushi is an intimidating individual. As a feline mink,
        Nekomamushi has the appearance of an anthropomorphic lion who dresses in
        simple garb. He also has a kiseru smoking pipe. Despite being a fierce
        warrior, Nekomamushi's feline qualities do not stop at just his
        appearance. One notable characteristic is his laugh, "goronyanya."
        "Gorogoro" is a Japanese onomatopoeia for purring while "nya" is the
        onomatopoeia for a cat's meow. This laugh adds an adorable touch to a
        ferocious guardian.
