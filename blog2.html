      <h1>10. Whitebeard Recruited A Slave Trader Into His Family</h1>

      <p class="font1">
        The squid-wearing Karma assisted Whitebeard's forces in the battle for
        Marineford. At first, he blended in as one of the series' unusually
        designed characters and did not play a particularly notable role.
        However, the Wano arc revealed the extent of his depravity. Karma first
        encountered Whitebeard when attempting to kidnap Kozuki Toki, Oden's
        wife. He only stopped when the emperor arrived personally. Given that
        Whitebeard later included Karma in his family, he implicitly condoned
        his actions.

      <h1>9. Big Mom Accidentally Killed Her Entire Adoptive Family</h1>
      <p class="font1">
        Having been abandoned by her biological parents, Charlotte Linlin, or
        Big Mom, as she'd later become known, was adopted by Carmel. She was the
        only woman with the time and patience to satiate Big Mom's appetite,
        coming time and again to her rescue when necessary. However, Big Mom's
        gluttony eventually got the better of her, and she accidentally devoured
        Carmel amidst one of her infamous hunger pangs. Though Big Mom laments
        Carmel's "disappearance" decades into the future, she never

      <h1>8. Blackbeard Is Indirectly Responsible For Ace's Death</h1>
      <p class="font1">
        While Akainu may have struck the killing blow, Blackbeard was ultimately
        responsible for Ace's death. He delivered the young man into the World
        Government's custody in exchange for the office of Warlord. Blackbeard's
        treachery was heinous for a number of reasons. Not only was Ace a former
        "family" member under Whitebeard's crew, but he also knew it would
        result in the Marineford conflict. Such dramatic global destabilization
        terrified populations across the world and resulted in territories
        previously belonging to Whitebeard coming under savage attack. To
        Blackbeard's credit, however, Ace attacked him first. Aokiji's
        intervention.

      <h1>7. Blackbeard Murdered Thatch & Stole His Devil Fruit</h1>
      <p class="font1">
        The Whitebeard pirates had a policy stating that whoever found a devil
        fruit first would be able to claim it. Unfortunately for Blackbeard,
        Thatch discovered the darkness fruit he spent years looking for.
        Nonetheless, Blackbeard would not be deterred. He exploited Thatch's
        trust to murder him and steal his power for himself. While Blackbeard
        realized that there was no going back to the Whitebeard Pirates, he
        didn't care. The villain had already become one of the most powerful
        fighters in the Grand Line; it only took the assassination of a comrade.

      <h1>6. Big Mom Attempted To Usurp The Kingdom Of Germa</h1>
      <p class="front">
        At first, the wedding Big Mom arranged between Pudding and Sanji seemed
        like a celebration for the ages. She invited guests from across the
        world to attend, with even the prestigious Big News Morgan making an
        appearance. However, everything was a ruse to usurp Germa 66's vast
        technology. The second Pudding was to kiss Sanji, Big Mom's pirates
        attacked Vinsmoke Judge and his children. Were it not for Luffy's
        unexpected intervention, the acquisition of Germa 66's cloning
        technology would've occurred without incident.

      <h1>5. Kaido Permitted Queen To Use Vile Bioweapons</h1>
      <p class="front">
        Queen was one of Kaido's most esteemed subordinates and was a critical
        member of his army. In addition to monitoring the brutal slave camp of
        Udon, he created vile bio-weapons that decimated his master's
        adversaries.However, given the virulent nature of Queen's plagues, it
        often spread to allies as well. The toxins proved so profoundly fatal
        that they even hospitalized Luffy, who had already developed strong
        antibodies against poisons from his fight with Magellan. Kaido's
        permissiveness of Queen's weapons suggests that he has no moral code
        when annihilating his enemies.

      <h1>4. Kaido Helped To Install Orochi As The Evil Shogun Of Wano</h1>
      <p class="front">
        Orochi was the despotic shogun of Wano for decades. Under his rule,
        dissent was crushed, history was erased, and famine spread like
        wildfire. Though his personal guard provided a layer of defense, he
        primarily used the Beast Pirates for serious threats. Considering the
        atrocities that Kaido's support enabled, he is directly responsible for
        Orochi's crimes. Since the shogun fed a starving village defective SMILE
        fruits to stop their complaining, there is little possibility that Kaido
        or Orochi are redeemable characters.

      <h1>3. Big Mom Exploited Thousands For Their Lifespans</h1>
      <p class="front">
        Living on Whole Cake Island came with a high price. Every year, Big Mom
        forced its residents to pay tribute in order to keep their homes and
        livelihoods. The cost was worse than money; instead, she took a fraction
        of their total lifespans. Some consider this trade to be fair. After
        all, they technically benefit from her protection as a Yonko. However,
        considering that their home may still be destroyed any time Big Mom has
        a hunger attack, their lives are devoid of justice or a sense of
        security.

      <h1>2. Kaido Instructed Jack To Destroy Zou</h1>
      <p class="front">
        Jack the Drought was a monstrous pirate and one of the three
        subordinates directly under Kaido's charge. He instructed him to find
        Raizo by any means necessary, which resulted in the destruction of Zou.
        When the Beast Pirates attacked, hundreds of innocent minks were put in
        danger,] their livelihoods completely destroyed. In the end, Jack was so
        desperate to fulfill his mission that he even attacked Zunesha directly
        in hopes of killing everyone in the city. Fortunately, Momonosuke
        commanded the great beast to defend itself and sink Jack's vessel to the
        bottom of the sea.

      </div>
      <h1>1. Blackbeard Nearly Killed Everyone At The End Of The Marineford Fight</h1>
      <p class="front">
        The climax of the Marineford arc revealed how evil Blackbeard actually
        was. In addition to ambushing and killing Whitebeard, he used the man's
        stolen power to attack the remaining pirates and the World Government -
        both he had gleefully betrayed. By this point, Blackbeard's power
        increased so dramatically that he became one of the few pirates with a
        bounty of more than one billion berries. After crushing the remnants of
        the Whitebeard pirates, he was also named a Yonko. Perhaps the most
        jarring aspect of Blackbeard's villainy is that, unlike Kaido or Big
        Mom, he has yet to be defeated.
