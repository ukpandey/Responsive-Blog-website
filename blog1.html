      <h1>10. Tashigi Is A Kind Albeit Determined Marine</h1>

      <p class="font1">
        Tashigi was a marine who debuted in the Loguetown arc. She serves as a
        perfect foil to Zoro, both for her weapon skills and the fact that she
        resembles a close childhood rival. Unlike many marine commanders,
        Tashigi shows genuine compassion to her subordinates, even the
        cutthroats of G-5. As a result, she is celebrated by her unit, both as a
        leader and as an individual. Her gentle nature also helps to keep Smoker
        from making radical decisions in his mission to capture pirates. One
        reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary
        plain language, spoken or written, is difficult or impossible. For
        example, semaphore, where the configuration of flags held by a signaler
        or the arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of the message, typically
        individual letters and numbers. Another person standing a great distance
        away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words sent.

      <h1>9. Helmeppo Had An Incredible Redemption Arc</h1>
      <p class="font1">
        Helmeppo was the spoiled son of Ax-Hand Morgan. Although growing up with
        a sense of entitlement, he quickly matured after his father's arrest and
        imprisonment. It encouraged him to take destiny into his own hands,
        train under Garp, and become a marine worth looking up to. While nowhere
        near Coby in skill, Helmeppo was still brave enough to be at the front
        lines of the Marineford conflict. In this regard, he has already
        surpassed his father in both power and heroism. Like Morgan, he also has
        a weapon of choice - a pair of deadly curved swords.
      </p>

      </div>
      <h1>8. Smoker Was A Grizzled Veteran Who Honored His Word</h1>
      <p class="font1">
        Despite being one of Luffy's most relentless pursuers throughout the
        East Blue saga, Smoker is remarkably honorable. He called off his
        marines at the end of the Alabasta arc even though he was in a great
        position to apprehend the Straw Hats. Though still considering them
        enemies at the time, Smoker respected that Luffy and Zoro saved his
        life. He demonstrated tremendous strength of character again in the Punk
        Hazard arc when refusing to sell Luffy out to Doflamingo. This was
        especially noble since the warlord would have executed him if not for
        Aokiji's intervention.
      </p>
      <div class="post-img">
        <img src="img/first4.jpeg" alt="" />
      </div>
      <h1>7. Coby Is A Promising Young Marine With A Bright Future</h1>
      <p class="font1">
        Luffy first met Coby as an abducted cabin boy on Alvida's ship. He told
        him that life was too short to be a prisoner and that he should always
        strive to fulfill his dreams regardless of the cost.Taking Luffy's words
        to heart, Coby joined the marines the second he could and began to
        train. Though still nowhere close to his goal, Coby has mastered CP9
        techniques in an astonishingly short amount of time. By the series'
        conclusion, he may prove a serious challenge.

      </div>
      <h1>6. Momonga Was A Straightforward & Courteous Vice Admiral</h1>
      <p class="front">
        Momonga was the vice admiral deployed to retrieve Boa Hancock for Ace's
        execution. Despite his entire crew being petrified, he was able to keep
        command of the situation, convincing the pirate empress to follow him
        and free his men. In return, Boa received the opportunity to visit Impel
        Down, which later resulted in a massive breakout. Unlike other vice
        admirals, Momonga's diplomacy allows him to find solutions in otherwise
        uncomfortable situations. He is also a talented soldier, as proven by
        his contributions against Whitebeard's forces.
      </p>

      </div>
      <h1>5. Fujitora Knew That Luffy Wasn't A Bad Person</h1>
      <p class="front">
        Most marines blindly believe that Luffy and his crew are agents of
        destruction. Although Fujitora initially fell for the World Government's
        dogma, he kept an open mind and observed Luffy's behavior firsthand.He
        was so impressed by the young man's efforts against Doflamingo that he
        even overlooked his escape once Dressrosa had been saved. Fujitora used
        the vast number of civilian vessels Luffy hid among to justify his
        restraint. If put in his situation, other admirals such as Akainu or
        Kizaru would not have been nearly so merciful
      </p>
      <div class="post-img">
        <img src="img/first7.jpeg" alt="" />
      </div>
      <h1>4. Aokiji Had His Own Sense Of Justice</h1>
      <p class="front">
        At first, Aokiji might appear to be another blind servant of the World
        Government. He helped to obliterate Whitebeard's forces at Marineford
        and relentlessly pursued Nico Robin across the Grand Line. However,
        Aokiji has shown mercy to the Straw Hats despite having many
        opportunities to kill them. For example, he passed up an opportunity to
        finish Luffy off after fighting him for the first time. Similarly, he
        did not interrupt Water Seven's victory celebration even though they
        were technically all enemies of the government.
      </p>

      </div>
      <h1>3. Jaguar D. Saul Stood Against The Buster Call</h1>
      <p class="front">
        Jaguar D. Saul was a giant vice admiral who washed up on Ohara. He
        quickly befriended Robin and learned more about the scribes living on
        the island. When the marines came, he was horrified by the massacre they
        intended to perpetrate and helped Robin escape by carrying her in his
        hands. Unfortunately, Saul was intercepted and killed by Aokiji.
        However, Aokiji was moved by Saul's sacrifice and did not prevent her
        from continuing her retreat. Considering that Akainu annihilated the
        evacuation ships, Robin is all that remains of her once-proud culture.
      </p>
      <div class="post-img">
        <img src="img/first9.jpeg" alt="" />
      </div>
      <h1>2. Sengoku Was A Steadfast Fleet Admiral</h1>
      <p class="front">
        Sengoku was the first fleet admiral to debut in the series. Under his
        command, Marineford held out against three powerful pirate emperors,
        Blackbeard, Shanks, and Whitebeard. He was perhaps the only marine
        capable of harming Blackbeard after mastering two devil fruits, which
        prevented thousands of deaths. Additionally, Sengoku's decision to allow
        Whitebeard a proper burial prevented what could have been a disastrous
        conflict with Shanks. Nonetheless, he retired and was replaced by Akainu
        shortly afterward. Though Sengoku remains affiliated with the marines as
        an advisor, he's nowhere as reputable as he was in his prime.
      </p>
      <div class="post-img">
        <img src="img/first10.jpeg" alt="" />
      </div>
      <h1>1. Garp Was A Model To Marines Everywhere</h1>
      <p class="front">
        Garp is one of the few marines to command the respect of pirates
        everywhere. This was seen when he teamed up with Gol D. Roger in order
        to defeat Xebec, putting an end to his villainy once and for all. Though
        powerful enough to become an admiral, Garp has declined the position
        time and again since he does not want to be a vassal of the Celestial
        Dragons. He is similarly opposed to the marines' excessive acts of
        barbarism, as seen when he attempted to attack Akainu for killing Ace at
        the battle for Marineford.
