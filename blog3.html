      <h1>11. Buggy</h1>

      <p class="font1">
        Buggy the Clown was once a young member of the Roger Pirates alongside
        future Yonko Redhair Shanks. Despite his early friendship with Shanks,
        Buggy does not even come close to the same level of power as him.In
        fact, Buggy is defeated by Luffy in Orange Town way back in the East
        Blue. Since then, Buggy has likely gotten stronger, but throughout the
        series, Buggy is shown to luck his way into his achievements, such as
        his warlord position, which he obtained only because of his connection
        to the Roger Pirates. Despite his devil fruit's potential, Buggy has
        been and remains a comic relief character.

      <h1>10. Gecko Moria</h1>
      <p class="font1">
        Gecko Moria at the Thriller Bark is past his prime. Once, Gecko Moria
        was said to be a rival to Kaido. But after having his crew wiped out,
        Moria lost his resolve and began to cultivate a crew of zombies that the
        Strawhats face at Thriller Bark. Moria's fruit has some strong
        abilities, but it is a very situational power that requires shadows in
        order to work. This means that if a fight happened during the day, Moria
        would already be at a significant disadvantage. Bearing in mind that
        Moria's power can be completely nullified by a speed blitz like when he
        was attacked by Donquixote Doflamingo, a fast opponent would spell
        trouble for Moria.

      <h1>9. Edward Weevil</h1>
      <p class="font1">
        Edward Weevil is the alleged son of Whitebeard, and while his
        intelligence leaves much to be desired, he makes up for it in raw
        strength. As a result of his naive nature, Weevil's mother, Miss Bakkin,
        manipulates him, ultimately seeking to destroy the former whitebeard
        pirates and secure Whitebeard's treasure. Weevil is mostly an unknown
        quantity, having not encountered the Straw Hats yet, but he
        single-handedly destroyed 16 of Whitebeard's allied crews. This feat is
        doubtlessly impressive, but its true scale is unquantifiable because the
        strength of the crews that Weevil fought is currently unknown. As a
        consequence of his mostly unknown nature, it can only be said that
        Weevil is at least strong enough to hold his own with some of his fellow
        warlords.

      <h1>8. Sir Crocodile</h1>
      <p class="font1">
        Crocodile is the antagonist of the Alabasta Saga. Crocodile's narrative
        follows Gecko Moria's, of an older generation of pirates who ventured
        into the New World only to be crushed by one of the Yonko. In his
        younger days, Crocodile's crew was crushed by Whitebeard in his prime,
        causing him to retreat into the Paradise section of the Grand Line and
        lose his ambitions to become the Pirate King. Crocodile having forsaken
        his dream puts him at a disadvantage. Though Having even survived
        against someone as powerful as prime Whitebeard shows that Crocodile was
        stronger in his younger years, he grew complacent during his scheming to
        take over Alabasta and did not train to attain a level of strength that
        would let them compete with some of their fellow warlords.

      <h1>7. Boa Hancock</h1>
      <p class="front">
        Boa Hancock is the empress of Amazon Lily, an island that is home to the
        Kuja Tribe, a tribe of all-female fighters. Hancock wields the Love-Love
        Fruit, which allows her to make her opponents fall in love with her. It
        affects the user regardless of their gender, and even works on the World
        Government's powerful Pacifista cyborgs. Hancock's fruit also has some
        limitations, the target must have lustful or loving thoughts in order
        for it to work. As such, her fruit did not work on Luffy, and others
        such as Mihawk and Crocodile have been shown to resist it. Hancock also
        has been shown to easily destroy Pacifistas, who are all based on Kuma,
        her fellow warlord.

      </div>
      <h1>6. Bartholomew Kuma</h1>
      <p class="front">
        Bartholomew Kuma is not only one of the warlords, but he's also a former
        member of the Revolutionary Army, and he was turned into a Pacifista by
        the world government. What separates him from the other Pacifistas is
        the Paw-Paw Fruit, which he used to single-handedly decimate the
        pre-time skip straw hat crew at Sabaody Archipelago.Kuma's Fruit is a
        frighteningly powerful and versatile one, with many of his attacks being
        light-speed by his own admission. Kuma is also likely to have the will
        to resist Hancock's Love-Love Fruit since he is able to resist his
        cyborg programming during his fights with the Straw Hats and spare them
        when he is supposed to capture or kill them.

      </div>
      <h1>5. Jinbe</h1>
      <p class="front">
        Jinbe is a master of Fish-Man Karate, which he has used to square off
        against powerful opponents like Big Mom. Jinbe can use his Fish-Man
        Karate to control water, creating massive tidal waves such as Vagabond
        Drill, which he used to knock back Big Mom during the Strawhat's escape
        from Whole Cake Island. Although the result of their fight is unknown,
        both appeared in Wano sometime later seemingly unharmed which speaks to
        Jinbe's abilities, putting him somewhere near the Yonko level.
      </p>
      <div class="post-img">
        <img src="img/third9.jpeg" alt="" />
      </div>
      <h1>4. Donquixote Doflamingo</h1>
      <p class="front">
        Donquixote Doflamingo is the main antagonist of the Dressrosa arc and
        has the String-String Fruit, which allows him to create incredibly sharp
        strings he can use to cut opponents or even stitch up his own wounds.
        Doflamingo can also use the strings for mobility, allowing him to swing
        around by attaching them to buildings and even clouds. His awakening
        also allows him to increase the strength of his attacks and defenses by
        weaponizing the environment. Doflamingo surviving a punch that shattered
        the island of Dressrosa shows that he has insane durability, even when
        fatigued from a long fight. However, Doflamingo held his own against
        Luffy's Gear Fourth but was ultimately overpowered by the
        transformation, a stronger version of which could not even make Big Mom
        or Kaido flinch.

      </div>
      <h1>3. Trafalgar D. Water Law</h1>
      <p class="front">
        Trafalgar D. Water Law is a man with as many names as abilities at his
        disposal. Law's devil fruit is one of the most complicated in the entire
        series. This wide toolkit makes Law a very powerful and versatile
        fighter, though, and has allowed Law to tangle with powerful fighters
        like Doflamingo and Big Mom. Law also recently displayed that he has
        awakened his devil fruit, and this, along with some teamwork with
        Eustass Kidd, was enough for him to take out Big Mom. Law stands just
        outside of the Yonko level of power, and that puts him well above many
        of his fellow Warlords

      <h1>2. Dracula Mihawk</h1>
      <p class="front">
        Dracule Mihawk, mentor to Zoro and rival of Redhair Shanks, is the most
        powerful swordsman in the world. That title alone put Mihawk in the top
        tier of fighters in One Piece, considering how many fighters we see
        wielding swords.It is not yet known exactly how powerful Shanks is but
        his fellow Yonko, Big Mom and Kaido, are both described as being
        inhumanly strong. Shanks also dissuaded Kaido from interfering in the
        war at Marineford so he can be considered relative to Kaido, and Mihawk
        can be considered to be above Shanks because he holds the title of the
        strongest swordsman in the world, placing him comfortably in the Yonko
        tier.
